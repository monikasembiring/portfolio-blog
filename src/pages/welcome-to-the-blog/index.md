Hi There!
I’m Monika Sembiring. I’m currently a recent graduate student from Carnegie Mellon University with focus on Business Intelligence and Data Analytics.

I am aspired to be a full stack data science or data analytics professional, especially utilizing data in product development.

Before my study, I worked as product managers in two startups in Indonesia. As product manager, I prioritize the backlog, do user research, define requirement documents, conduct sprint, and manage my team.

In this blog, I will elaborate more about the project I did that I cannot show the code directly too you. 

I hope you find something useful here. Enjoy your time looking around!

Btw, if you have any feedback, suggestions, or questions; or even want to discuss something writes down here, feel free to reach me out on Twitter anytime! I will very happy to have a discussion with you.

Again, welcome to my blog!
