# Welcome!

I created this repository to have a blog where I can write down a more detailed story about my project that **cannot have the code exposed due to privacy** or **my projects as a product manager who is not having access to the code to be presented**. This blog is customized based on the DevBlog template by Ryan Fitzgerald(https://ryanfitzgerald.github.io/devblog/).

For the other technical projects where I can share the code, you can check my technical portfolio on [monikasembiring.github.io](https://monikasembiring.github.io/).

I hope you enjoy it and find something useful in the blog!
